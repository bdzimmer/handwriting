# handwriting

handwriting is a work-in-progress handwriting recognition system. My initial goal is transcription of pages of my handwriting (I use pen on college-ruled paper and scan at 300 dpi) that is accurate enough to be faster than retyping.

Currently, I'm using traditional image processing techniques for extracting lines and words, and  I'm using convolutional neural networks for finding the positions of characters and classifying them.
